Behavioral RSA 
Script by Nadu Barbashova 

This an R script to practice conducting representational similarity analysis on behavioral data. This script generates some simulated data as a way to practice. 
There are multiple aproaches to RSA. One can test a single model to see if the predicted similarity structure (in the model RDM) correlates with the observed similarity structure of the data (the behavioral RDM) significantly. 
One can compare multiple models by including them in a multiple regression to see which one best explains the behavioral data. 

To run this script make sure the pacman library is installed.
